# hello-world
Storage Bay 01 for Nikolas Ayers
Hello! I am Niko, and I am just starting coding, and I find it pretty fun to do. 
I just wish high school would allow me to do it more often. 
I hope to get familiar with all different types of code and scripts.
I am also possibly thinking of starting a YouTube channel, and coding could definitely help me there. 
I am also not sure what exactly this website is for, I am guessing collaborating on coding projects, but hope to find out and use it soon!
